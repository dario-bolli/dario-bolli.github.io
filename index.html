There, I had the opportunity to delve into Computational Neuroscience through a Minor in Neuroinformatics, a dual approach at the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and Computational Neuroscience.
							Employing Artificial Intelligence tools for the analysis and modeling of neuroscience data facilitates the understanding of neural mechanisms and offers valuable insights into the fundamental principles of biological intelligence. This, in turn, advances the field of Artificial Intelligence, fostering innovation and societal impacts.
							<br>
							<br>
							My commitment to research and innovation led me to <a href="https://www.zurich.ibm.com/sto/memory/"> IBM Research's In-memory computing Lab</a> in Zurich, where I worked for six months on brain-inspired solutions to address the ever-increasing need for computational resources in Machine Learning.
							I then spent a year at the Brain and Behaviour Lab, in the Bioengineering department at Imperial College London, under the expert guidance of <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.faisal"> Prof. Aldo Faisal </a>. 
							My work there focused on developing computational models of motor-learning mechanisms to address neurodegenerative diseases. 
							<br>

							<p> Welcome to my personal Website! 
							My name is Dario, I am a final-year MSc student in the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering  at ETH Zurich.

							Our brain, despite being at the core of our conscious experiences, remains shrouded in mystery, with much yet to be understood about its operations.
							My interests lie in the intersection of Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence.<br>
							The human brain, as an immensely efficient computational system, seamlessly navigates complex environments, engages in decision-making, abstract reasoning, sensory perception, and mediates all of our conscious experiences. However, much is still unknown to this day about how it operates. 
							<br>
							<br>
							The comprehension of neural mechanisms provides valuable insights into the fundamental principles of biological intelligence, thereby driving progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence, which in turn fosters innovation and instigates societal impacts.
							<br>
							While the latest developments in the AI field have caused significant harm to the society, by fueling an economy of attention, propagating misinformation, and amplifying divisions, I firmly believe that AI's potential can be leveraged for our benefit.
							Through an intelligent utilization, AI offers an avenue to effectively address a broad spectrum of societal challenges encompassing enhanced healthcare, personalized user experiences, safer transportation, environmental sustainability, and faster decision-making.
							Moreover, Computational Intelligence serves as a powerful tool for exploring both well-established and novel scientific problems across diverse domains.
							Concurrently, the integration of insights from neural mechanisms with cutting-edge advancements in machine learning offers promising opportunities for the development of pioneering diagnostic tools, therapies, and innovative rehabilitation techniques, aimed at addressing chronic neurological conditions. 
							<br>
							<br>
							In essence, my interests reside in leveraging the exceptional potential of the human brain's neural mechanisms to create transformative AI solutions, thereby positively impacting both daily life and the future of scientific advancements.<br>
							<br>
							I recently completed my master's thesis within the Bioengineering department at Imperial College London, under the expert guidance of <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.faisal"> Prof. Aldo Faisal </a>. 
							My work there focused on comprehending and developing computational models of motor-learning mechanisms to address neurodegenerative diseases, and more broadly to contribute to the general comprehension of the human brain.

								<article id="Computational-model-of-Motor-Learning">
									<h2 class="major">Computational model <br>
										of Motor-Learning</h2>
									<p>
										In this project, we investigate the underlying processes driving sensorimotor learning in
										real-world settings. To reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios, a pool experiment was introduced.
										A behavioural analysis of both the pool task and a more conventional motor adaptation
										task is carried out under two different visual feedback conditions.
										A thorough review of the literature is conducted, with a focus on learning based on
										sensory prediction error and reward feedback. </p>

										<p>Our study aims to explore the coexistence of two distinct mechanisms thought to take place in the cerebellum and basal ganglia.
										Based on the anatomical characteristics of these brain regions, it has been proposed
										that the cerebellum constructs an internal model of the world to predict the consequences
										of motor commands. The disparities between predictions and observed outcomes
										subsequently enable the adjustment of behaviour. Whereas the basal ganglia rely on binary
										reinforcement feedback to adjust the movement.
										It has been demonstrated that implicit movement adaptation can be achieved through
										reliance on either sensory prediction error or reward feedback. 
										When confronted with the multiple degrees of freedom and variables in a realworld
										task, such as playing pool, opposing trends in neural biomarkers thought to signal
										the learning related to specific feedback suggest that participants adopt different strategies.
										The nature of the information provided by these two feedbacks indicates the use of
										different underlying mechanisms.
										To further explore this, the real-world pool task was adapted to provide specific feedback
										on the examination of each underlying mechanism individually. To establish a baseline
										for our findings, a traditional visuomotor rotation hand-reaching task provided specific
										visual feedback was conducted in the laboratory.</p>

										<p>This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the experiments, with a primary focus
										on the reward condition, as the error condition is already well-established in the
										literature. Following a thorough review of the motor adaptation field and an analysis of
										the observed behaviours in the experiments, we defined two simple adaptation models
										adapted to our experiments. These models make minimal assumptions, are supported
										by anatomical evidence related to the cerebellum and basal ganglia and include experimentally
										verified concepts to exploit the information conveyed by the two feedbacks
										differently. They allow a clear interpretation of the underlying high-level processes and
										fundamental function of the nervous system and can be readily
										extended to other motor adaptation tasks.
										Fitting the parameters of these models to the participants who received error feedback in
										the reaching and pool tasks showed to be consistent with the prevailing theory of learning
										based on sensory prediction error using an internal forward model that is updated
										through Bayesian integration.</p>
										
										<p>In the context of reward feedback, the model captured the overall adaptation pattern in
										terms of average behaviour, success rate and variability in both tasks. Additionally, the
										model exhibited characteristic features of reward-based adaptation, including suboptimality and reward-dependent variability modulation.
										This confirms that the learner actively regulates variability in his movements based on
										the performance history to explore the motor space and maximise the reward in a realworld
										task.
										In conclusion, the high-level models proposed confirmed several hallmarks of sensorimotor
										adaptation in a real-world task. They require minimal assumptions and allow
										for explainability of the underlying processes, providing a solid foundation for further
										research into sensorimotor adaptation.</p>

										<p>These models present promising avenues for enhancing our comprehension of the functional
										roles played by the cerebellum and basal ganglia in sensorimotor adaptation. This,
										in turn, contributes to a better understanding of neurodegenerative diseases affecting
										these structures, such as cerebellar stroke, cerebellar ataxia, or Parkinson’s disease.
										Specifically, the real-world pool task setup could be adapted to detect the absence of
										the reward modulation of movement variability in patients suffering from Parkinson’s
										disease. Furthermore, personalised therapy could be developed by intelligently manipulating
										visual feedback for patients to maximise its effectiveness.
										Finally, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the overall functioning of
										the human brain.

									in a Real World Task</h2>
								<p>In this project, we aim at investigating the neurobehavioural dynamics of sensorimotor learning in real-world settings.
									We proceed in a first time to a literature review of the relevant research in the field of
									motor adaptation and reinforcement learning.</p>

									<p>In the second part, we build on top of an existing paradigm to observe learning mechanisms
									in a real-world task.
									We employ a data-driven approach to model the reward-based learning mechanism in a
									visuomotor adaptation task.
									Specifically, we aim at learning a behaviour policy for the task of playing billiards by
									observing the actions performed by human participants in a real-world setting harnessing
									the capabilities of offline reinforcement learning.</p>

									<p>Our Artificial Agent is able to learn a real-world task policy by observing the actions of
									a human behaviour policy. This framework further allows the analysis of the learning
									trends when introducing a visuomotor perturbation.
									Finally, we propose avenues for future research building on this paradigm to enhance our
									understanding of motor-learning mechanisms.

							<article id="Training-Superposition">
								<h2 class="major">Training in Superposition</h2>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>To address the always greedier need of Deep Neural Networks for computational resources,
									we investigate training and inference in superposition.
									Exploiting the properties of Hyper-Dimensional Computing, our concept seeks to reduce
									computation by superposing multiple data examples in a single compressed representation,
									hence processing the examples simultaneously in the Network.</p>

								<p>We validate the proposed method on image classification on the CIFAR-100 Dataset,
									using ResNet-12 as a base Classification Network.
									We first investigate the impact of binding and unbinding operations on the input and
									output of the ResNet-12. Next, we add a bundling operation to combine the inputs
									before processing them through the Classification Network.</p> 

								<p>Our Results show that the Hyper-Dimensional Computing method does not allow to
									process multiple images together. Therefore, we modify the initial architecture, and test
									several data-driven methods derived from this hypothesis.</p>

								<p>We also provide an analysis of the image classification accuracy relative to the number
									of computational operations saved by means of processing data in superposition.
									Our best architecture allows to divide by two the number of Multiply-Accumulate operations
									with a roughly 4.5% reduction in the image classification accuracy when compared
									with the original ResNet.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Deep-Hedging</h2>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>Hedging is a risk management strategy employed to balance losses in investments by taking an opposite position in a
									related asset. Mathematical finance provides a tractable solution to hedging in a frictionless and "complete market"
									models with risk-neutral pricing and hedging.
									However, trading is subject to transaction costs, permanent market impact, and liquidity constraints in real markets,
									something not modelled by classical mathematical finance models.</p>

								<p>Deep hedging aims at modeling the trading decisions in the hedging strategies as neural networks. It provides a model-free and efficient solution, enabling us to consider alternative factors
            					such as market frictions. Deep Hedging models' feature sets consist of hedging instruments' prices and can contain additional information such as trading signals, news analytics, or past hedging decisions.

							<!--Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving Project-->
							<article id="DLAD">
								<h2 class="major"> Deep Learning for <br>
									Autonomous Driving </h2>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>The goal was to do Multi-task learning for semantics and depth estimation on images gathered by 2 cameras mounted on a car, and 3D Object Detection from a Point Cloud gathered by a Lidar, also mounted on the car.
									The project was split in the 3 following parts:</p>
									
								<ol>
									<li>
									<h5>Understanding Multimodal Driving Data</h5>
									<p>That is, creating the visualisation tools for the 3D object detection and point cloud semantic segmentation given a LiDAR point cloud, corresponding RGB camera image, ground truth semantic labels and network bounding box predictions.
									  And processing the Lidar point Cloud, to be able to identify each laser ID from the point cloud directly, and account for the distortion caused by the vehicle motion with the aid of GPS/IMU data.</p>
									<p style="font-size: 11px">If you want to see more, you can have a look at <a href="documents/DLAD_Task1.pdf" >the task</a>, <a href="documents/DLAD_Report1.pdf">the report</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dario-bolli/Project_1_DLAD">the code</a></p>
								  	</li>

									<li>
								  	<h5>Multi-task learning for semantics and depth</h5>
									<p>The two main tasks in this part are the semantic segmentation (i.e., the task of associating each pixel of an image with a class label, e.g., person, road, car, etc.) and the monocular depth
										estimation (i.e., the task of estimating the per-pixel depth of a scene from a single image). 
										We worked on the Miniscape dataset.
										The idea is to train those tasks jointly using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), as the learning of one of the task can be beneficial to solve the other task.
										We derive an optimal joint architecture based on a shared, separate Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and separate Decoders to solve both tasks.</p>
									<p style="font-size: 11px">If you want to see more, you can have a look at <a href="documents/DLAD_Task2.pdf" >the task</a>, <a href="documents/DLAD_Report2.pdf">the report</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dario-bolli/Project_2_DLAD">the code</a></p>
									</li>
								
									<li>
									<h5>3D Object Detection from Lidar Point Clouds</h5>
									<p>In the last part, we build a 2-stage 3D object detector to detect vehicles in autonomous driving scenes. Our object-detector draws 3D bounding boxes around each vehicle.
										The First stage, which is often referred to as the Region Proposal Network (RPN), is used to create coarse detection results from the irregular point cloud data.
										These initial detections are later refined in the second stage network to generate the final predictions. 
										The idea behind such a 2-stage design is to process the entire point cloud in the first stage and to generate regions-of-interest (ROI), i.e. smaller pools of information at and around
										likely objects which later can be refined individually to form the final detection.
										In this project, the first stage was prebuilt and pretrained to save time. Therefore, we worked on the
										initial predictions (i.e. the results of the first stage RPN alongside the extracted features and point cloud data). </p>

								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>As part of the Communication Networks lecture at ETH Zurich, we, as a group of three, successfully implemented the following two projects: </p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<h5>Routing Project</h5>
										<p>The goal of the project is to build and operate an internet-like network infrastructure. Similarly to real networks, our network spans over layer-2 (using switches)
											and layer-3 (using routers). The network also connects (at layer-3) to other networks using the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol that provides IP connectivity within an autonomous system  (AS).
											Finally, using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to advertise prefixes between different ASes allow the creation of an internet-like network infrastructure.</p>

									</li>
									<li>
										<h5>Communication Project</h5>
										<p>The task of the second project is to implement a reliable TCP-like transport protocol allowing the communication of binary data over unreliable IP networks such as the internet.
